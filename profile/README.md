# The plan

The goal is to create the same application using a different Javascript ecosystem each time.

## The App

WIP : A Magic the Gathering deck-builder application using the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api)

## List of stacks repos planned

*Using Typescript if available with said library/framework.*

- Vanilla
- React
- Vue
- Svelte
- Angular
- Solid
- Alpine
- Web Components

*Meta frameworks (and SSR with them) might be better for a second iteration once the base technology is done eg: React first, then Remix/Next.*

## Guidelines

- If possible, opt for stack dependant library if one is needed to experience its own ecosystem rather than stack-agnostic packages.

- Opt for clean code that is easy to read and understand, performance and optimization is not the primary goal.

- Regardless of the stack, include unit testing and consider separation of logic and display as much as possible.
